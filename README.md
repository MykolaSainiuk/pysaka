# What again?
Another? logger to offload the main thread of the main process to not affect performance.

    import PysakaLogger from 'pysaka';

    const logger = new PysakaLogger();

    // log your stuff

    // in the end, please, close it
    // otherwise it will prevent the main process to be closed
    logger.close();
    // or sync way
    logger.closeSync();

    logger<write>('Hello world!');
